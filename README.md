# Group 10 : NFT Marketplace

It is quite clear that blockchain technology and NFTs can offer the perfect 
opportunity for artists and content creators to obtain financial remuneration for their 
works. Now, artists don’t have to depend anymore on auction houses or galleries for 
selling their artwork. On the contrary, an artist could just sell their work to a buyer 
in the form of NFT. The marketplace allows people to buy sell and trade NFT art. If 
you seek an industry that functions as a massive revenue stream for talented people 
like composers and artists, then NFT marketplace development can be the perfect 
match. NFTs’ integration of augmented reality and virtual reality is an innovation to 
the field that stimulates the appearance of new unique tech solutions. The NFT cap 
serves as great proof of an industry expansion; in 2022, it achieved the mark of 
$828 million. NFT marketplace development is a unique opportunity for individuals to 
show up and represent their collectibles to encourage effective digital asset 
management.
